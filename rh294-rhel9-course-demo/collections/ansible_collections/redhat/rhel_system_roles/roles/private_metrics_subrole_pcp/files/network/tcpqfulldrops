backlog queue is full.  This occurs when the kernel, accepting new
connections on behalf of a service, has received the client SYN
message, but had not yet received the client ACK, when the SYN backlog
is overrun.  This is likely to be observed mainly on systems with SYN
cookies disabled, as the kernel will enter a different state when they
are enabled (the tcpqfulldocookies rule detects that situation).";
