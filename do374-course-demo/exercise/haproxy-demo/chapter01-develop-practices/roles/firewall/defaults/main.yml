# defaults file for firewall


# This role requires that firewall_rules variable
# be defined. The variable is a list of rules, and
# each rule defines:
#
#   service: (optional)
#   port:    (optional)
#   zone:    (optional)
#   source:  (optional)
#
# A rule should only define a service or a port.
# And example definition is:
#
# firewall_rules:
#   - service: http
#     zone: internal
#   - port: 8443
#     source: 192.168.0.2

# By default, no rules are implemented.
